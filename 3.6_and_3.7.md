# Homework Hack one

```python
# Get user's age as input
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Check if the user is eligible to vote
if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
else:
    print("You are not eligible to vote.")
```



# Homework Hack two

```python
# Get user's health status as input
health_status = input("Enter your health status (healthy, doesn't care, unhealthy): ").strip().lower()

# Determine what the user would eat based on their health status
if health_status == "healthy":
    print("You should eat an apple.")
elif health_status == "doesn't care":
    print("You should drink coffee.")
elif health_status == "unhealthy":
    print("You should eat chocolate.")
else:
    print("Invalid health status entered.")
