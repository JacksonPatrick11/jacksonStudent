### popcorn hack for 3.2.1 ( find numbers divisble by 2)

```python
# PopCorn Hack: Find numbers divisible by 2

# List of numbers to check
numbers = [10, 15, 23, 40, 50, 67, 82, 91]

# Function to find numbers divisible by 2
def find_divisible_by_two(num_list):
    divisible_by_2 = [num for num in num_list if num % 2 == 0]
    return divisible_by_2

# Call the function and store the result
divisible_numbers = find_divisible_by_two(numbers)

# Output the result
print("Numbers divisible by 2:", divisible_numbers)

#output: 
#Numbers divisible by 2: [10, 40, 50, 82]


```

### Hack Number 1 (3.8.1) funciton to caluclate the factoial of a number

```python
# Recursive function to compute factorial
def compute_factorial(num):
    # Base case: If num is 0, return 1 (as 0! = 1)
    if num == 0:  
        return 1
    # Edge case: If num is negative, return 'undefined' because factorials don't exist for negative numbers
    elif num < 0:  
        return "undefined"
    # Edge case: If num is a float, return a message because factorial for non-integers isn't standard
    elif isinstance(num, float):  
        return "cannot be solved without the gamma function"
    # Recursive case: num * factorial of (num - 1)
    # The function calls itself, decreasing the number each time until it hits the base case (num = 0)
    else:
        return num * compute_factorial(num - 1)  

# Example use case with recursion
# Call the function with a specific number (e.g., 9) and store the result
factorial_result = compute_factorial(9)

# Output the result in a formatted string
print(f"The factorial of 9 is {factorial_result}!")

#output:
#The factorial of 9 is 362880!


```


### homework Hack 2 (3.8.8)

```python
# Homework Hack: Iterate through a list and apply conditions

# Given list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# For loop to iterate through the list
for num in numbers:
    if num == 3:  # Skip the number 3
        continue
    elif num == 5:  # Stop the loop once the number 5 is encountered
        break
    else:
        print(num)  # Print numbers that are not skipped or cause the loop to break


#output:
#1
#2
#4
```
