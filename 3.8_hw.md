## **3.8 JavaScript and Python Hacks Overview**

In these hacks, I explored essential algorithms and logic-based tasks using both Python and JavaScript. The focus was on creating functions for real-world problems like finding numbers divisible by 2, calculating factorials, and iterating through lists with specific conditions. These exercises provided valuable insights into how to handle mathematical operations, recursive functions, and control flow in programming.

### **Memorable Takeaway**
The standout moment from these hacks was understanding how recursion works in calculating factorials. By building a function that calls itself, I learned to break down problems step by step, a crucial skill in both mathematical problem-solving and real-world programming applications.

### **How You Can Apply It**
- **Divisibility and Conditionals**: Learning to check conditions like divisibility and using control flow (if-else, continue, break) helps with tasks like validating user input or processing large data sets efficiently.
- **Recursive Functions**: Understanding recursion is essential for solving problems that require repeated actions, like navigating file structures or solving complex mathematical equations.
- **Iterating Through Lists**: Mastering iteration and applying conditions within loops helps when managing dynamic lists or filtering data, which is vital for both frontend and backend development tasks.

### **Why It's Important**
These hacks are fundamental in developing problem-solving skills and writing efficient, readable code. They prepare me to:
- Tackle complex logic problems.
- Implement algorithms that require recursive solutions.
- Manage data flows dynamically, improving the user experience in web applications.

### popcorn hack for 3.2.1 ( find numbers divisble by 2)

```python
# PopCorn Hack: Find numbers divisible by 2

# List of numbers to check
numbers = [10, 15, 23, 40, 50, 67, 82, 91]

# Function to find numbers divisible by 2
def find_divisible_by_two(num_list):
    divisible_by_2 = [num for num in num_list if num % 2 == 0]
    return divisible_by_2

# Call the function and store the result
divisible_numbers = find_divisible_by_two(numbers)

# Output the result
print("Numbers divisible by 2:", divisible_numbers)

#output: 
#Numbers divisible by 2: [10, 40, 50, 82]


```

### Hack Number 1 (3.8.1) funciton to caluclate the factoial of a number

```python
# Recursive function to compute factorial
def compute_factorial(num):
    # Base case: If num is 0, return 1 (as 0! = 1)
    if num == 0:  
        return 1
    # Edge case: If num is negative, return 'undefined' because factorials don't exist for negative numbers
    elif num < 0:  
        return "undefined"
    # Edge case: If num is a float, return a message because factorial for non-integers isn't standard
    elif isinstance(num, float):  
        return "cannot be solved without the gamma function"
    # Recursive case: num * factorial of (num - 1)
    # The function calls itself, decreasing the number each time until it hits the base case (num = 0)
    else:
        return num * compute_factorial(num - 1)  

# Example use case with recursion
# Call the function with a specific number (e.g., 9) and store the result
factorial_result = compute_factorial(9)

# Output the result in a formatted string
print(f"The factorial of 9 is {factorial_result}!")

#output:
#The factorial of 9 is 362880!


```


### homework Hack 2 (3.8.8)

```python
# Homework Hack: Iterate through a list and apply conditions

# Given list of numbers
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# For loop to iterate through the list
for num in numbers:
    if num == 3:  # Skip the number 3
        continue
    elif num == 5:  # Stop the loop once the number 5 is encountered
        break
    else:
        print(num)  # Print numbers that are not skipped or cause the loop to break


#output:
#1
#2
#4
```
