# Five Key Contributions to Cantella – Trimester 2

Over the past 12 weeks, I played a significant role in **Cantella’s development**, focusing on **feature implementation, frontend UX design, team leadership, and collaboration**. Below are **five major contributions** I made to the project:

---

## 1️⃣ AP US History Quiz – Randomized Static Question Pool  
One of my main tasks was developing an **AP US History quiz**, featuring **a pool of 50 questions** that dynamically rotate, ensuring variety in each quiz session.

### **How It Works:**
- **Static question pool** of 50 questions, each with **multiple-choice answers**.
- **Random selection** of 10 questions per quiz attempt.
- **Seamless frontend experience**, dynamically displaying questions while tracking answers.

This feature made **history studying more engaging** by introducing variety and encouraging repeated practice.

---

## 2️⃣ Dynamic Leaderboard with CRUD Operations  
I implemented a **leaderboard system** that dynamically updates based on quiz scores. This included **full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality**, allowing users to manage scores efficiently.

### **Key Features:**
- 📊 **Real-time leaderboard updates** displaying high scores.
- 🛠 **Admin-controlled leaderboard editing**, allowing score adjustments.
- 🔒 **Password-protected admin feature**, ensuring only authorized users can modify entries.

This feature added a **competitive aspect** to the quiz and improved user engagement.

---

## 3️⃣ Leading Stand-Up Meetings & Team Organization  
While our **Scrum Masters focused on assigning tasks**, I ensured that our team remained **on track, accountable, and well-coordinated**. My responsibilities included:
- **Running stand-up meetings**, checking in with teammates on progress.
- **Keeping team members organized** by breaking down tasks.
- **Ensuring work alignment**, so all features integrated smoothly.

By maintaining **consistent communication**, I helped our team **stay productive and focused**.

---

## 4️⃣ Frontend UX Design – Improving Usability  
Beyond my main coding tasks, I played a major role in **enhancing the user experience (UX)** across multiple features.

### **Key UX Improvements:**
- 🔄 **Simplified Flashcards** – Originally confusing and hard to use, I reorganized their layout and interactions.
- 🏷 **Revamped Profile Page** – Made it clearer and easier to navigate.
- 🛑 **Fixed UI inconsistencies** – Adjusted buttons, removed unnecessary features, and decluttered pages.

By refining **design and usability**, I ensured Cantella was **intuitive and user-friendly**.

---

## 5️⃣ Cross-Team Collaboration & Debugging  
I worked closely with **both my teammates and members from other groups** to **solve bugs and improve functionality**.

### **Collaboration Highlights:**
- 🛠 **Bug-fixing sessions** with **Trevor, Jackson Hensley, Carson Rowan**, and others.
- 📞 **Team-wide discussions** to resolve backend/frontend integration challenges.
- 🖥 **Code troubleshooting** to fix major issues across different pages.

This collaborative effort **improved overall code quality** and made Cantella more **functional and polished**.

### here is me taking interest in Rowans Ceramics Project. She explained to me how thre are multiple steps in ceramics proejects, Wedging the clay, throw the clay, shave the clay, add a handle, FIRE it. This is simlar to the CSP design proceess and how code functions, where one missed step can mess up the final outcome drastically.
