# ðŸŒŸ **Welcome to My Sprint 2 BLog** ðŸŒŸ

<p style="color: teal; font-size: 18px;">
This blog highlights my work and projects related to Python and Java arrays/lists, focusing on Unit 3 of the AP CSP curriculum. Over the course of Sprint 2, I completed lessons on Big Ideas (BI) 3.1-3.8 and 3.10, preparing myself for both the classroom presentations and my personal projects. The blog documents my growth through hands-on coding tasks, grading, and a self-study final, with a focus on connecting JavaScript to frontend coding and HTML manipulation. It also includes my reflections on how this work prepares me for future challenges, including the CB exam and Project Based learning ðŸ’»

### Review of 3.10 Javascript Lists

In **3.10 Javascript Lists**, I focused on deepening the understanding of arrays in JavaScript and how they differ from Python lists. I demonstrated how to create, access, modify, and remove elements from arrays using clear examples. 

Key highlights include:
- Establishing arrays and using `.length` to access elements, since negative indexing isn't supported like in Python.
- Removing elements with methods like `pop()`, `shift()`, and `splice()`, and checking for element existence with `indexOf()`.
- The classwork hack involved reversing an array in place, encouraging students to problem-solve without creating a new array.

This section is memorable because it built on familiar concepts while introducing JavaScript-specific techniques. Arrays are fundamental to managing data efficiently in JavaScript, making this lesson crucial for understanding dynamic data handling in programming.
