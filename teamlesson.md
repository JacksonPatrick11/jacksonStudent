# **Bias in AI & Technology**  

### **Popcorn Hack:** An example of bias could be **TikTok ads** showing content based on stereotypical assumptions rather than true user interests.  

üìå **Lesson 1: Algorithmic Bias in Social Media**  
- Many social platforms curate content using **engagement-based AI**, which can reinforce stereotypes.  
- Example: TikTok‚Äôs ad system may prioritize beauty-related ads for women and finance-related ads for men, limiting exposure to diverse opportunities.  

üìå **Lesson 2: When Technology Fails in Critical Moments**  
- **Real-life example:** My phone lost service on a mountain, forcing me to climb higher for a signal.  
- **Key Takeaway:** Over-reliance on technology can leave us vulnerable in emergencies. Offline preparedness is just as important as online access.  

üìå **Lesson 3: The Importance of Ethical AI**  
- **Issue:** AI-driven recommendation engines, such as YouTube‚Äôs, can inadvertently promote extremist content.

# üìå Homework Hack #1: Digital Tool Bias Analysis

## üéØ Chosen Digital Tool: **YouTube**

### üîç Identifying Potential Bias  
YouTube‚Äôs recommendation system often **reinforces user preferences** by suggesting content similar to what a person has previously watched. This can lead to **filter bubbles**, where users are exposed to only one perspective on a topic.  
Additionally, YouTube‚Äôs algorithm has been criticized for **favoring certain demographics**‚Äîpromoting mainstream creators over smaller or diverse channels, making it harder for underrepresented voices to gain visibility.

### ü§î Analyzing the Cause  
The bias stems from:  
- **Algorithmic reinforcement:** YouTube‚Äôs AI prioritizes engagement (watch time, likes, and shares) over diverse content, leading to **echo chambers**.  
- **Monetization influence:** Advertiser-friendly content is promoted more, often sidelining **controversial or niche topics**.  
- **Lack of diverse training data:** The recommendation system may not equally represent **content from smaller or non-English-speaking creators**.  

### ‚úÖ Proposed Solution  
YouTube could implement:  
- **A diversity toggle:** An optional feature allowing users to receive **content from a wider range of perspectives** outside their usual recommendations.  
- **Balanced AI training:** The algorithm should be tested with **diverse datasets** to reduce overrepresentation of specific content.  
- **Improved transparency:** Provide users with **explanations** on why a video is recommended and offer **more manual control** over feed customization.  

By implementing these changes, YouTube can **reduce bias** and create a more **inclusive** content ecosystem. üöÄ
