# **Bias in AI & Technology**  

### **Popcorn Hack:** An example of bias could be **TikTok ads** showing content based on stereotypical assumptions rather than true user interests.  

üìå **Lesson 1: Algorithmic Bias in Social Media**  
- Many social platforms curate content using **engagement-based AI**, which can reinforce stereotypes.  
- Example: TikTok‚Äôs ad system may prioritize beauty-related ads for women and finance-related ads for men, limiting exposure to diverse opportunities.  

üìå **Lesson 2: When Technology Fails in Critical Moments**  
- **Real-life example:** My phone lost service on a mountain, forcing me to climb higher for a signal.  
- **Key Takeaway:** Over-reliance on technology can leave us vulnerable in emergencies. Offline preparedness is just as important as online access.

# üìå Homework Hack #1: Digital Tool Bias Analysis

## üéØ Chosen Digital Tool: **YouTube**

### üîç Identifying Potential Bias  
YouTube‚Äôs recommendation system often **reinforces user preferences** by suggesting content similar to what a person has previously watched. This can lead to **filter bubbles**, where users are exposed to only one perspective on a topic.  
Additionally, YouTube‚Äôs algorithm has been criticized for **favoring certain demographics**‚Äîpromoting mainstream creators over smaller or diverse channels, making it harder for underrepresented voices to gain visibility.

### ü§î Analyzing the Cause  
The bias stems from:  
- **Algorithmic reinforcement:** YouTube‚Äôs AI prioritizes engagement (watch time, likes, and shares) over diverse content, leading to **echo chambers**.  
- **Monetization influence:** Advertiser-friendly content is promoted more, often sidelining **controversial or niche topics**.  
- **Lack of diverse training data:** The recommendation system may not equally represent **content from smaller or non-English-speaking creators**.  

### ‚úÖ Proposed Solution  
YouTube could implement:  
- **A diversity toggle:** An optional feature allowing users to receive **content from a wider range of perspectives** outside their usual recommendations.  
- **Balanced AI training:** The algorithm should be tested with **diverse datasets** to reduce overrepresentation of specific content.  
- **Improved transparency:** Provide users with **explanations** on why a video is recommended and offer **more manual control** over feed customization.  

By implementing these changes, YouTube can **reduce bias** and create a more **inclusive** content ecosystem. üöÄ

# Big O and Algorithm Efficiency

## üß† Notes

**Big O Notation** measures how efficient an algorithm is as input size increases. It focuses on:

- **Time Complexity**: How long it takes.
- **Space Complexity**: How much memory it uses.

### üî¢ Common Complexities

| Big O     | Name           | Description                                |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| O(1)      | Constant        | Doesn't grow with input size.              |
| O(log n)  | Logarithmic     | Grows slowly as input increases.           |
| O(n)      | Linear          | Grows directly with input size.            |
| O(n log n)| Linearithmic    | Faster than quadratic, used in good sorts. |
| O(n¬≤)     | Quadratic       | Nested loops‚Äîgets slow fast.               |
| O(2‚Åø)     | Exponential     | Doubles each time‚Äîvery slow.               |
| O(n!)     | Factorial       | Terribly slow‚Äîonly for very small inputs.  |

### üß† Undecidable Problems Homework

Modern operating systems and browsers have built-in mechanisms to detect and manage infinite loops or long-running scripts to keep the system responsive.

#### üñ•Ô∏è Operating Systems:
- **Watchdog Timers** monitor programs. If a process stops responding for too long, the OS may force it to close (e.g., ‚ÄúNot Responding‚Äù messages in Windows).
- **Resource Management** systems monitor CPU/memory usage and can terminate processes that exceed limits.

#### üåê Browsers:
- Most modern browsers (like Chrome or Firefox) will show a warning such as:  
  > ‚ÄúA script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding.‚Äù
- Browsers automatically stop or prompt users to stop long-running scripts.
- Example: JavaScript infinite loops (e.g. `while(true) {}`) can freeze the page. The browser detects this and may kill the script or crash the tab.

#### üîç Real-World Example:
- **Google Chrome** has a built-in **tab freeze and crash recovery** system.
- If a page consumes too many resources, Chrome will suspend the tab or show an error like:  
  > ‚ÄúAw, Snap! Something went wrong while displaying this webpage.‚Äù

These safeguards don‚Äôt **solve** undecidability, but they help prevent system or browser crashes by detecting behavior that *could* result from an undecidable process.

### üß† Graphs & Heuristics Homework

**Social Network Analysis (SNA)** uses **graph theory** to understand relationships and interactions between people or entities on social media platforms.

#### üîó Nodes & Edges in Social Networks:
- **Nodes (Vertices):** Represent individual users or accounts.
- **Edges (Connections):** Represent relationships or interactions between users.
  - These can be **directed** (e.g., follows on Twitter) or **undirected** (e.g., Facebook friendships).
  - They can also be **weighted** to show strength or frequency of interaction (e.g., number of messages sent).

#### üì± Real-World Example: Facebook
- **Facebook** uses graphs to model friendships, recommend friends, detect communities, and track information flow.
- Graph-based algorithms help Facebook suggest new friends by analyzing **mutual connections** and **network proximity**.

Graphs enable platforms to:
- Find **influential users** (central nodes).
- Detect **clusters or communities** (people with lots of mutual connections).
- Identify potential **spam bots or fake accounts** using pattern analysis.

In short, graph theory helps social media platforms **organize, analyze, and optimize** the vast web of user interactions.
