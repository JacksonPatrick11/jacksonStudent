# 📌 Homework Hack #1: Digital Tool Bias Analysis

## 🎯 Chosen Digital Tool: **YouTube**

### 🔍 Identifying Potential Bias  
YouTube’s recommendation system often **reinforces user preferences** by suggesting content similar to what a person has previously watched. This can lead to **filter bubbles**, where users are exposed to only one perspective on a topic.  
Additionally, YouTube’s algorithm has been criticized for **favoring certain demographics**—promoting mainstream creators over smaller or diverse channels, making it harder for underrepresented voices to gain visibility.

### 🤔 Analyzing the Cause  
The bias stems from:  
- **Algorithmic reinforcement:** YouTube’s AI prioritizes engagement (watch time, likes, and shares) over diverse content, leading to **echo chambers**.  
- **Monetization influence:** Advertiser-friendly content is promoted more, often sidelining **controversial or niche topics**.  
- **Lack of diverse training data:** The recommendation system may not equally represent **content from smaller or non-English-speaking creators**.  

### ✅ Proposed Solution  
YouTube could implement:  
- **A diversity toggle:** An optional feature allowing users to receive **content from a wider range of perspectives** outside their usual recommendations.  
- **Balanced AI training:** The algorithm should be tested with **diverse datasets** to reduce overrepresentation of specific content.  
- **Improved transparency:** Provide users with **explanations** on why a video is recommended and offer **more manual control** over feed customization.  

By implementing these changes, YouTube can **reduce bias** and create a more **inclusive** content ecosystem. 🚀

# Big O and Algorithm Efficiency

## 🧠 Notes

**Big O Notation** measures how efficient an algorithm is as input size increases. It focuses on:

- **Time Complexity**: How long it takes.
- **Space Complexity**: How much memory it uses.

### 🔢 Common Complexities

| Big O     | Name           | Description                                |
|-----------|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| O(1)      | Constant        | Doesn't grow with input size.              |
| O(log n)  | Logarithmic     | Grows slowly as input increases.           |
| O(n)      | Linear          | Grows directly with input size.            |
| O(n log n)| Linearithmic    | Faster than quadratic, used in good sorts. |
| O(n²)     | Quadratic       | Nested loops—gets slow fast.               |
| O(2ⁿ)     | Exponential     | Doubles each time—very slow.               |
| O(n!)     | Factorial       | Terribly slow—only for very small inputs.  |

---

## 🧪 Examples

### O(1) - Constant Time
```python
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
print(arr[2])  # Access by index is constant time
```

### 🧠 Undecidable Problems Homework

Modern operating systems and browsers have built-in mechanisms to detect and manage infinite loops or long-running scripts to keep the system responsive.

#### 🖥️ Operating Systems:
- **Watchdog Timers** monitor programs. If a process stops responding for too long, the OS may force it to close (e.g., “Not Responding” messages in Windows).
- **Resource Management** systems monitor CPU/memory usage and can terminate processes that exceed limits.

#### 🌐 Browsers:
- Most modern browsers (like Chrome or Firefox) will show a warning such as:  
  > “A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding.”
- Browsers automatically stop or prompt users to stop long-running scripts.
- Example: JavaScript infinite loops (e.g. `while(true) {}`) can freeze the page. The browser detects this and may kill the script or crash the tab.

#### 🔍 Real-World Example:
- **Google Chrome** has a built-in **tab freeze and crash recovery** system.
- If a page consumes too many resources, Chrome will suspend the tab or show an error like:  
  > “Aw, Snap! Something went wrong while displaying this webpage.”

These safeguards don’t **solve** undecidability, but they help prevent system or browser crashes by detecting behavior that *could* result from an undecidable process.






Graphs & Heuristics


### 🍿 Popcorn Hack Answers

**Popcorn Hack #1**  
❌ **False**  
> In a **directed graph**, an edge from node A to node B **does not** imply a corresponding edge from B to A. That would only be true in an **undirected graph**.

**Popcorn Hack #2**  
✅ **True**  
> Heuristics often provide **faster** solutions than exact algorithms, but they may **sacrifice accuracy**. They’re approximations, not guaranteed optimal.

**Popcorn Hack #3**  
✅ **True**  
> Heuristic algorithms like Nearest Neighbor are fast but **don’t guarantee optimality**. As cities increase, the gap between heuristic and optimal solutions can grow **exponentially**.

### 🧠 Graphs & Heuristics Homework

**Social Network Analysis (SNA)** uses **graph theory** to understand relationships and interactions between people or entities on social media platforms.

#### 🔗 Nodes & Edges in Social Networks:
- **Nodes (Vertices):** Represent individual users or accounts.
- **Edges (Connections):** Represent relationships or interactions between users.
  - These can be **directed** (e.g., follows on Twitter) or **undirected** (e.g., Facebook friendships).
  - They can also be **weighted** to show strength or frequency of interaction (e.g., number of messages sent).

#### 📱 Real-World Example: Facebook
- **Facebook** uses graphs to model friendships, recommend friends, detect communities, and track information flow.
- Graph-based algorithms help Facebook suggest new friends by analyzing **mutual connections** and **network proximity**.

Graphs enable platforms to:
- Find **influential users** (central nodes).
- Detect **clusters or communities** (people with lots of mutual connections).
- Identify potential **spam bots or fake accounts** using pattern analysis.

In short, graph theory helps social media platforms **organize, analyze, and optimize** the vast web of user interactions.
