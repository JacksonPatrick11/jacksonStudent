## **Homework Hack #2: Ethical AI Coding Challenge**  
### **Problem:** AI in facial recognition leading to racial bias.  
- **Risk:** Studies, such as MIT's *Gender Shades* project, found that facial recognition technology from companies like Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft had higher error rates for darker-skinned individuals, leading to wrongful arrests and discrimination.  

### **Proposed Solutions:**  
1. **Diverse Training Data:** IBM and Microsoft have worked to improve their AI by incorporating more diverse datasets, reducing racial bias.  
2. **Human Oversight:** In 2020, IBM stopped selling facial recognition software for law enforcement due to concerns about bias and misuse.  

### **Reflection:**  
Ethical AI development is important because biased technology can cause real-world harm, such as wrongful accusations and discrimination. By ensuring AI systems are fair, accurate, and accountable, we can build a society where technology enhances rather than limits human rights.

## **Homework Hack #3: AI & Unintended Consequences Research Task**  
### **AI Example:** YouTube‚Äôs Recommendation Algorithm  
- **What Happened:**  
  - YouTube‚Äôs AI-powered recommendation system was designed to maximize user engagement.  
  - However, studies found that it often pushed users toward extreme, misleading, or harmful content to keep them watching longer.  
  - Reports from *The New York Times* and *MIT Technology Review* revealed that YouTube played a role in radicalizing individuals by feeding them increasingly extreme videos.  

- **Response:**  
  - In 2019, YouTube updated its algorithm to limit recommendations of harmful conspiracy theories and misinformation.  
  - Google also introduced fact-checking panels on YouTube to provide context for misleading content.  

- **Prevention:**  
  - AI developers should test for harmful patterns before launching recommendation algorithms.  
  - Implementing stricter AI ethics reviews and transparency reports can help identify and mitigate risks.
