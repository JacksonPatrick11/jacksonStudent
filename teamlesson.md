## **Homework Hack #2: Ethical AI Coding Challenge**  
### **Problem:** AI in facial recognition leading to racial bias.  
- **Risk:** Studies, such as MIT's *Gender Shades* project, found that facial recognition technology from companies like Amazon, IBM, and Microsoft had higher error rates for darker-skinned individuals, leading to wrongful arrests and discrimination.  

### **Proposed Solutions:**  
1. **Diverse Training Data:** IBM and Microsoft have worked to improve their AI by incorporating more diverse datasets, reducing racial bias.  
2. **Human Oversight:** In 2020, IBM stopped selling facial recognition software for law enforcement due to concerns about bias and misuse.  

### **Reflection:**  
Ethical AI development is important because biased technology can cause real-world harm, such as wrongful accusations and discrimination. By ensuring AI systems are fair, accurate, and accountable, we can build a society where technology enhances rather than limits human rights.
